/* To be able to be compatible with CPython (in both CPython and Universal ABI
   modes) we need to reserve some space at the beginning of user-defined
   structs which will contain ob_refcnt and ob_type. However, HPy users should
   not be able to access them directly.

   Alternate implementations are free to use this extra space as they
   want. Moreover, if they do NOT need this extra space, they can avoid
   wasting memory by allocating sizeof(_HPyObject_head_s) bytes less inside
   their implementation of HPy_New.
