# PEG Parser for Python Sources

This is early prototype of the PEG parser for Python sources. The prototype
is not finished yet and it is under development.

We try to keep all the data structures, ast nodes, parser generator, etc. to be
very close to CPython. One reason is that the `ast` module in CPython is
considered to be relatively stable API. To avoid an additional layer of mapping
and a lot of headache, we simply stick as closely as possible to CPython. The
other reason is that at the time of this writing (CPython 3.10 was just
released), the grammar is still changing quite a bit, with big refactorings
happening in pegen and the official Python grammar and still more parser
features being planned.

## Structure of sources

* python - contains python sources needed for generating java parser
    * pegen - python peg parser used for parsing grammar and java parser generator
uses classes from this parser. It's a copy from CPython peg parser. Needs to be updated manually.
`TODO - change this`
    * pegjava - contain parser java_generator (written in Python) and the
grammar. The grammar is taken from Python grammar for generated C parser.
* src/main/java - sources needed for the parser itself. Also there is tokenizer written in java.
* src/test/java - tests for the generated parser and tokenizer
* src/test/resources/tokenizer - test files
    * testfiles - contains files with extension `.data`, where every line is a test case for tokenizer.
    * goldenFiles - golden files, that are generated from python `python generateGoldenFiles.py`. Java tokenizer test then
checks, whether it has the same results as the python tokenizer.
    * generateGoldenFiles.py - used for generating golden files from the test files

## Development

* Clone appropriate version (3.10 and above) of CPython somewhere and build it.
* Create venv and activate it
* Generate new version of the java parser: `python src/main/python/mainParserGen.py`.
* For development you can use NetBeans and then build and run the tests from the IDE
* Or you can build it and test from commandline in the top folder (where pom.xml is located)
    * build: `ant jar`
    * run tests: `ant test`

## TODO
* when a rule in grammar returns token, then the generated parser can generate the `Token` as well. Like in [TYPE_COMMENT]

### Updating the grammar

We have modified the grammar actions and return types to match the Java
code. The git history shows the modifications were done to a CPython grammar
file. To update the grammar, check out the branch `grammar-import`. Get the
latest CPython grammar (in the CPython source `Grammar/python.gram`) and put it
over `src/main/python/pegjava/python.gram` (that's the only file in that
branch). Update also `src/main/python/pegen` from CPython. Then commit to the
python-grammar branch and push that branch. Now go back to master. And do `git
merge grammar-import`. Resolve any conflicts. Now regenerate the Java parser.

We try to keep the grammar almost entirely the same, changing only actions if we
can. Some rule names and some return types had to be changed as well,
however. But we try to keep these kind of changes to a minimum. The
`java_generator.py` that implements the parser generator is based as closely as
possible on the `c_generator.py` from the pegen project. This, too, should make
it easier to keep up with upstream development.

##### To see what we changed in the grammar

    git diff --word-diff grammar-import -- src/main/python/pegjava/python.gram

##### To update the grammar

    git checkout grammar-import
    cp /PATH/TO/CPYTHON/SOURCE/Grammar/python.gram src/main/python/pegjava/python.gram
    git rm -rf src/main/python/pegen
    cp -R /PATH/TO/CPYTHON/SOURCE/Tools/peg_generator/pegen src/main/python/
    git add src/main/python/pegjava/python.gram src/main/python/pegen
    git commit -m "Update Python PEG grammar and generator to version INSERT-SHA1"
    git checkout master
    git merge grammar-import
