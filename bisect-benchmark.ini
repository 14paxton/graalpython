[bisect-benchmark]
# This is the configuration file for bisecting benchmark jobs in the CI.
# Usage:
# - Create a temporary branch based on master (or the bad commit)
# - Fill in this configuration file, commit the changes and push it
# - Execute the bisect-benchmark job for the commit. When you click the "create
#   PR" link, you can run jobs in commits UI (Actions). You need to wait a bit
#   for the job enumerator to populate the job list. You don't need to actually
#   create any PR.
# - Wait for the jobs to finish. You should get an email when it's done

# The command to build particular configuration. You can copy paste this from
# the benchmark job log. Don't worry about sforceimports, the script takes care
# of that
build_command = mx --dy /compiler build

# The commmand to run the particular benchmark on the configuration. You can
# copy paste this from the benchmark job log. Make sure you replace the '*'
# wildcard with a single benchmark, the script only supports bisecting a single
# benchmark at a time
benchmark_command = mx --dy /compiler benchmark micro:try-except-simple

# The first known "bad" merge commit for bisection. Try to use long commit
